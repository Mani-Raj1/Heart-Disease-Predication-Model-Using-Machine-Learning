❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate, the model helps in early detection of heart disease, which can assist doctors and healthcare professionals in decision‑making.

🎯 Objective
To analyze patient health data
To build a machine learning model that predicts heart disease
To improve early diagnosis using data‑driven insights

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature selection
Model training and evaluation
Performance comparison of algorithms

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy – Data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit‑learn – Machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

 All 14 Attributes
Age – Age of the patient
Sex – Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
Chest Pain Type (cp) – Type of chest pain (0–3)
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps) – Blood pressure at rest (mm Hg)
Cholesterol (chol) – Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs) – >120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
Resting ECG (restecg) – Electrocardiographic results (0–2)
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise‑Induced Angina (exang) – (1 = yes, 0 = no)
ST Depression (oldpeak) – Depression induced by exercise
Slope – Slope of peak exercise ST segment (0–2)
Number of Major Vessels (ca) – Colored by fluoroscopy (0–3)
Thalassemia (thal) – Blood disorder type (1–3)
Target – Heart disease present (1) or not (0)

✅ Model Output
The trained model predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not based on input medical features.

🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in the healthcare domain to predict heart disease effectively. It showcases skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem‑solving using real‑world datasets.
